# I Don't Know Where I Want To Eat! 
An app that will randomly pick a place to eat based off of your location

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was two fold:
1. To continue to practice python skills
2. To create an application that will randomly pick a restaurant based off of location when no one will pick a place to eat. 


## How it Works:
1. A user is asked "What city, state are you in?"

2. That information is then used to determine their coordinates.
3. Their coordinates are used during during a Yelp API call to retrieve a list of restaurants near by.

4. The program than randomly picks a restaurant based off of the results to go eat at.

## Future Ideas/Updates:
- Write the code in JavaScript and make a webpage to improve access and ease of use.
- Add "Things to Do" option in addition to Restaurants
